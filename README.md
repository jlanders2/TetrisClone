# Tetris Clone (Incomplete)

Creating a Tetris clone in C to practice C programming and learn more about Raylib (awesome library btw!).

## Description

This game is a clone of the popular game Tetris. This clone features what you would expect from a simplistic version of Tetris, namely: falling blocks, which upon completion of a row disappear, score keeping and levels with incremental difficulty.

Here are some early screenshots of my progress:

![gameplay](screenshots/game_screenshot.png "Gameplay")
![gameover](screenshots/game_over_screenshot.png "Game Over")

Features left to implement:
- Update codebase to use cohesive style (still haven't landed on exactly what I like)
- Re-Implement rotation algorithm; my original algorithm was extremely buggy
- Empty rows that are full should "break"
- Broken rows should cause other rows to shift down without losing ordering
- scoring system
- display upcoming block
- introduce levels and increasing speed/score multiplier

I hope you enjoy!
